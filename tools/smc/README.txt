Bug Fixes:

(All)
    smc-anttask now recognizes all currently supported SMC target
    languages.
    (SF bug 207, 208)

(Objective C)
    getPreviousState() now returns the correct value *after* a
    transition completes.
    (SF bug 209)

(C++ using -crtp)
    When using -crtp, the generated code now outputs the correct
    getOwner() methods:

        inline DERIVED& getOwner() {...}
        inline const DERIVED getOwner() const {...}
    (SF bug 210)

(Graphviz)
    The Graphviz .dot file now defines all transitions after
    defining subgraphs. This corrects the problem of subgraphs
    containing incorrect states due to jump transitions between
    subgraphs.
    (SF bug 211)

(All)
    Corrected Makefile and smc.mk so that staging/Release
    directory is automatically created if it does not already
    exist. Also added macros to smc.mk which specify the Java
    source and target versions.
    (SF bug 212)

0. What's New?
--------------

Major changes:

[C++]
    Added a new "-crtp" (Curiously Recurring Template Pattern)
    option making FSM integration into an application easier and
    more efficient. Instead of the user class containing an FSM
    data member like "AppClassContext _fsm", the user class
    publicly inherits the context like:

        class AppClass : public AppClassContext<AppClass>

    A transition is issued by calling the transition method
    directly rather than through the _fsm data member. So the
    call "_fsm.Open()" becomes "Open()". This removes one layer
    of indirection from user code.

    All C++ examples had their Makefiles updated to include two
    macros for the CRTP feature. Uncomment these macros and
    compile to see how this feature works.

[C++]
    Added a new "-stack max-state-stack-depth" option. This
    option generates a fixed-size state stack with the specified
    maximum depth. No dynamic memory is allocated for the state
    stack.

    Caveat: use this option only if 1) your FSM uses the push
    transition, and 2) your push transitions can only reach a
    well-defined maximum limit. Conversely, if your FSM does not
    use push transitions or your push limit is unbounded, then do
    not use this option.

    This option can be used in combination with "-noex" to create
    a C++ FSM which performs no dynamic memory allocation (since
    C++ exceptions automatically use dynamic memory allocation.)

    C++ example EX3 was updated to demonstrate this feature.


Minor changes:

(All)
    Added a new directive "%fsmfile" and modified the behavior or
    "%fsmclass". Previously, directive "%fsmclass" set both the
    FSM class name *and* file name. Now "%fsmclass" sets only the
    FSM class name and "%fsmfile" sets the file name in which it
    is stored.

(C#)
    Added the attribute
    [System.CodeDom.Compiler.GeneratedCode("smc", "x.x.x")]
    to each generated class. This attribute is used by source
    analyzers such as FxCop.

(Java)
    Updated -java7 -reflection to emit a public final class for
    each map. This class contains a public static final State7
    field for each of the map's states. The purpose behind this
    feature is to restore the ability to reference states as
    "<map name>.<state name>". When using -java7, it is
    preferable to reference a state using the integer constant
    named "<map name>_<state name>_STATE_ID".


Bug Fixes:

(All)
    The -version command line option returns the wrong version.
    (SF bug 202)

(Java)
    -java7 generates invalid code for transitions with generic
    parameters.
    (SF bug 203)

(Php)
    Using -php and -reflect emits an incorrect name for the
    Default state. In Php, the Default state is named "Default_"
    so as not to conflict with a Php reserved word.
    (SF bug 204)

(Php)
    The previous state is not set in action-less transitions.
    (SF bug 205)

(Java)
    -java7 does not correctly fall through to the Default
    transition. This is due to the actual transition having a
    different method signature than the Default transition (which
    has not parameters).
    (SF bug 206)

0. What's New?
--------------

Major changes:

(All)
    SMC is now compiled with Java 1.7 and requires JRE 1.7 or
    better to run.

(SMC Language)
    The Default state is explicitly not allowed to have Entry and
    Exit action blocks. This is because "Default" is not an
    actual state but a psuedo-state used to start default
    transition definitions.

    Previously, Entry and Exit blocks could be defined for the
    Default state but nothing was done with them. Now these
    definitions will cause a compile error.
    (SF bug 3602051)

    The generated C++ source file #includes are not correctly
    guarded with #if's.

    The -hsuffix is not used when generating the #include.
    (SF bug 3468873)

(All)
    The state map identifier generator is reset to zero for each
    state map. The state map identifier is no longer reset,
    guaranteeing a unique identifier for each state.
    (SF bug 3481674)

(All)
    Previous state incorrectly set to null.
    (SF bug 3482199)

(JavaScript)
    Generates an invalid comment block.
    (SF bug 3484428)

(C, C++)
    When -d and -headerd are both used, the generated source file
    #include for the generated header file may contain an
    incorrect relative path.
    (SF bug 3505374)

2. Introduction
---------------

If you use state machines to define your objects behavior and are
tired of the time-consuming, error-prone work of implementing
those state machines as state transition matrices or widely
scattered switch statements, then SMC is what you're looking for.

SMC takes a state machine definition and generates State pattern
classes implementing that state machine. The only code you need
to add to your object is 1) create the state machine object and
2) issue transitions. ITS THAT EASY.

+ NO, you don't have to inherit any state machine class.
+ NO, you don't have to implement any state machine interface.

YES, you add to your class constructor:

        _myFSM = new MyClassContext(this);

YES, you issue state transitions:

        _myFSM.HandleMessage(msg);

Congratulations! You've integrated a state machine into your
object.

SMC is written in Java and is truly "Write once, run anywhere".
If you have at least the Java Standard Edition v. 1.6.0 loaded,
then you can run SMC (if you have the Java Enterpise Edition, so
much the better!)

Java Standard Edition can be downloaded for FREE from

                    http://java.sun.com/j2se/

SMC currently supports fourteen programming languages:
  1. C,
  2. C++,
  3. C#,
  4. Groovy,
  5. Java,
  6. Lua,
  7. Objective-C,
  8. Perl,
  9. PHP,
 10. Python,
 11. Ruby,
 12. Scala,
 13. [incr Tcl] and
 14. VB.Net.

SMC is also able to generate an HTML table representation of your
FSM and a GraphViz DOT file representation
(http://www.graphviz.org).


3. Download
-----------

Surf over to http://smc.sourceforge.net and check out
"File Releases". The latest SMC version is 6.0.0.
SMC downloads come in two flavors: tar/gzip (for Unix)
and self-extracting zip file (for Windows).

The download package contains the executable Smc.jar and
supporting library: statemap.h (for C++), statemap.jar
(for Java), statemap.tcl & pkgIndex.tcl (for Tcl),
statemap.dll (for VB.Net) and statemap.dll (for C#).

NOTE: Only the SMC-generated code uses these libraries. Your code
doesn't even know they exist. However, when compiling your
application, you will need to add a
    -I<path to statemap.h directory>
or
    -classpath ...:<path to statemap.jar>
to your compile command (when running you Java application, you
also need to add statemap.jar to your classpath).

The download package's directory layout is:

4. Installation
---------------

After downloading SMC (either tar/gzip or self-extracting zip
file), you install SMC as follows:

1. Figure out where you can to load the Smc directory and place
   the SMC package there.
2. If you already have an "smc" directory/folder, change its name
   to something like "smc_old" or "smc_1_2_0". This will prevent
   its contents from being overwritten in case you want to back
   out of the new version. Once you are satisfied with the new
   version, you may delete the old SMC.
3. Load the SMC package:
    (Unix) $ tar xvfz Smc_6_0_0.tgz
    (Windows) running Smc_6_0_0.zip

You're done! There really is nothing more that needs to be done.
You may want to take the following steps.

+ Add the full path to .../Smc/bin to your PATH environment
  variable.
+ Add the full path to statemap.jar to your CLASSPATH environment
  variable.
+ Add the full path to .../Smc/lib to your TCLLIBPATH environment
  variable.

The tools directory includes a Maven plug-in
(http://www.maven.org) and an ant task to help integrate SMC
into other development environments.

An Eclipse plug-in is not yet available.


5. Examples
-----------

The examples directory contains example SMC-based applications.
The examples range from trivial (EX1) to sophisticated (EX5).
Use these examples together with the SMC Programmer's Guide to
learn how to use SMC.

The C++ examples provide Makefiles, Microsoft DevStudio 6.0
workspace and DevStudio 7.0 solution.

The Java examples in examples/Java use "make" for building.
The same examples also appear in examples/Ant and use "ant".

The [incr Tcl] examples are not built and require you to
execute "java -jar Smc.jar" by hand.

The VB.Net and C# examples use DevStudio 7.0.

To learn more about each example and how to build & run each one,
read the example's README.txt.
