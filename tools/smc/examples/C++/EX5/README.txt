+ Building
----------

NOTE: Smc.jar must be built and installed.

Unix:
    $ make sleeper

Windows Visual C++:
    1. Load ex1.dsw.
    2. Rebuild all.


+ Executing
-----------

Unix & Windows:

    $ sleeper
    (hit control-C, enter a single word, i.e. no spaces, followed
     by return. To stop execution, enter "stop". For fun, hit
     control-C twice in quick succession.)
