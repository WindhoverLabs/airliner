# Revision 1.6  2007/12/28 12:34:40  cwrapp
# Version 5.0.1 check-in.
#
# Revision 1.5  2005/11/07 19:34:54  cwrapp
# Changes in release 4.3.0:
# New features:
#
# + Added -reflect option for Java, C#, VB.Net and Tcl code
#   generation. When used, allows applications to query a state
#   about its supported transitions. Returns a list of transition
#   names. This feature is useful to GUI developers who want to
#   enable/disable features based on the current state. See
#   Programmer's Manual section 11: On Reflection for more
#   information.
#
# + Updated LICENSE.txt with a missing final paragraph which allows
#   MPL 1.1 covered code to work with the GNU GPL.
#
# + Added a Maven plug-in and an ant task to a new tools directory.
#   Added Eiten Suez's SMC tutorial (in PDF) to a new docs
#   directory.
#
# Fixed the following bugs:
#
# + (GraphViz) DOT file generation did not properly escape
#   double quotes appearing in transition guards. This has been
#   corrected.
#
# + A note: the SMC FAQ incorrectly stated that C/C++ generated
#   code is thread safe. This is wrong. C/C++ generated is
#   certainly *not* thread safe. Multi-threaded C/C++ applications
#   are required to synchronize access to the FSM to allow for
#   correct performance.
#
# + (Java) The generated getState() method is now public.
#
# Revision 1.4  2005/05/28 13:51:24  cwrapp
# Update Java examples 1 - 7.
#
# Revision 1.1  2004/10/30 12:01:58  charlesr
