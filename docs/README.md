## Requirements to build airliner(Tested on Ubuntu18)
`libgazebo9-dev`  
`libboost-all-dev`  
`python3-opencv`  
`libopencv-dev`

Must install the following dependencies via pip3:

### To build docs.

This is known to work with Python 3.6

1. `pip3 install sphinx`
2. `pip3 install sphinx-rtd-theme`
3. `pip3 install breathe`
4. `pip3 install sphinxcontrib-doxylink`
5. `pip3 install graphviz`
6. `sudo apt-get install graphviz`
7.  From the repository base airliner directory `make docs`

To open up the documentation you can run this command `xdg-open airliner/build/reference/default/docs/html/index.html` on Ubuntu-based distros.

These were generated by a tool called `breathe-apidoc` which parses xml doxygen-generated files to rst files and enables us to link to structs/classes/data structures that exists on our doxygen docs with very simple syntax from rst files.
