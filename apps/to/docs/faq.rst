#. *Do I have to use CCSDS?*

   No, you can transmit messages with any protocol you want.  Messages published on the software bus
   and received by TO just need to be translated (or encapsulated) to the new protocol.  You need to
   use, or create, "custom" code that translates the messages to the new protocol.
