(Q) What is the basic flow of the application?

The FAC application uses a common application format. When the app starts, initialization is performed, then the app enters an infinite loop waiting for commands from the software bus. 

Detailed activities documentation is available `here <../../doxy/apps/fac/cfsfacfaqs.html>`_.
