  <H2> Scope </H2>

  This document provides a complete specification for the commands and telemetry associated
  with the SIM Application (SIM) software.  The document is intended primarily 
  for users of the software (operations personal, test engineers, and maintenance personnel).  
  The last section of the document, the deployment guide section, is intended for mission 
  developers when deploying and configuring this application software for a mission 
  flight software build environment.

  ====  

  (Insert text describing steps required to integrate the application with a CFS system.  This should
   include:
     1) References to message IDs that need to be inserted into a CFS Scheduler table
     2) References to telemetry that can be generated
     3) Additional description of application configuration parameters that may need to be modified.
        For example, questions that a systems integrator needs to have answered before the application
        can be successfully integrated
     4) References to the application's performance ID)

  Initial Integration
  ====

    The first step in deploying the SIM application is to do stuff.

  Application Tailoring to the Mission
  ----
    
    The sim_mission_cfg.h file, the sim_msgids.h, and the sim_perfids.h files
    are tailored for the mission.  These are built into the application during
    compilation.

  Application Tailoring to the Platform
  ----

    In the sim_platform_cfg.h file, there are configuration parameters that control
    SIM application behavior.  This should be tailored to the specific platform
    needs.  This behavior is built into the application during compilation.

  CFS Scheduler Support
  ----

    TODO Discuss any commands that must be included in the CFS Scheduler Table
    and any related tailoring/configuration.

/**
    \page cfssimcons SIM Application Operational Constraints
  
  (Instructions to the author)
  ====

  (Insert text that describes:
    1) situations that would prevent the application from starting
    2) causes for the application to terminate prematurely
    3) commands that cannot be issued either out of order or without sufficient wait time, etc) 

  Application Termination
  ====

    Potential causes for SIM to terminate prematurely are an error return from the 
    software bus in the application main loop or error return from one of the cFE table
    services functions when SIM tries to do table management (check for updates, dump 
    requests etc.) during each housekeeping cycle. 

  Critical Data Store Operation
  ====
    
    When using the Critical Data Store (CDS), the results tables and housekeeping data
    will only be restored if the application was shut down through cFE Executive Services 
    and exited clean. If this is not the case, default values will be used 
    (see \ref cfssimfaqs).

  General
  ====

  <B> (Q)
     What is the basic flow of the application?
  </B> <BR> <BR> <I>
     The SIM application uses a common application format. When the app starts, 
     initialization is performed, then the app enters an infinite loop waiting for
     commands from the software bus.
