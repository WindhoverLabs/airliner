#######################################################################################

A CFS application runs as a child thread in non-realtime OS, like Linux, and as a task
in realtime OS, like VxWorks.

Once invoked (automatically done by the CFE services), the application first initializes
its data, including creations and registrations of message pipes and tables, subscriptions
to other applications' output data, etc.  It waits for the cFE startup sync.  Once
that is received it enters a main loop, awaiting for messages to respond to.
(From hereon, this will be referring to as listening mode.)

App Behavior:
=============
When in listening mode, there are 2 specific messages the application should respond to:

1) SIMLINK_WAKEUP_MID

   This message is normally sent by the CFS message scheduler.  Only upon receiving
   this message would the application start doing work.  When woken up, the application
   will first process and respond to all incoming commands.  Then, it will process
   all incoming data.  Next, it performs 1-cycle worth of data processing.  And last,
   it sends out its output data (SIMLINK_OUT_DATA_MID) before going back to the
   listening mode.

   The application's output data is published at its running rate.  It should contain
   data to be recorded on-board (not downlinked) and data to be consumed by other
   applications.

2) SIMLINK_SEND_HK_MID

   This message is normally sent by the CFS message scheduler.  Upon receiving this
   message, the application sends out its latest housekepping data (SIMLINK_HK_TLM_MID)
   to be downlinked to the ground.  Then it goes back to the listening mode.

   The application's housekeeping data is published only upon receiving an
   SIMLINK_SEND_HK_MID message.  It should contain ONLY essential data that the ground
   system needs in order to run the mission effectively.

Commands:
=========
	
In addition to the WAKEUP and SEND_HK commands, this app has a NOOP command and
a RESET command.

The NOOP command increments the command counter in the housekeeping data.
The RESET command resets the command and command error counters in the
housekeeping data.

Tables:
=========
This application has two tables, a "config" table and a "CDS" table.  The
config table holds the app configuration data that affects app behavior. It
 is loaded from a table file.

The CDS table is data preserved across processor resets in the cFE CDS.
This CDS data is generated by the app and not loaded from a table file.

cFE Softare Bus Pipes:
======================
This application has three cFE Software Bus pipes for receiving messages.  They
are kept separate because this app's design prioritizes responsiveness to
the SIMLINK_WAKEUP_MID and SIMLINK_SEND_HK_MID commands over other
messages.

The "scheduling" pipe subscribes to the above wakeup and send housekeeping
commands.

The "command" pipe subscribes to other app command messages.

The "data" pipe subscribes to other incoming data messages for processing.
