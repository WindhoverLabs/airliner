  \page cfsvmovr VM Application Overview
    
  The VM Application (VM) application enables safe vehicle commanding, additionally detects failure and executes contingent action.
    
  VM Design Overview
  ====

  The VM Application (VM) has three components. <BR>
  1. System Routines<BR>
  2. Arming State Machine<BR>
  3. Navigation State Machine<BR>

  System Routines
  ====
  The Routines performed by VM include battery management, listening to RC commanding, checking for citicality and warnings.
  
  Arming State Machine
  ====
  The state machine initializes at a start state (Init) then moves to default state (Standby) and waits for further transitions.<BR>
  The state machine handles trasitions between states and guards against illeagal transitions of the states.<BR>
  The states that can be found in this state machine are:<BR>
  1. Init<BR>
  2. Standby<BR>
  3. Armed<BR>
  4. StandbyError<BR>
  5. ArmedError<BR>

  Navigation State Machine
  ====
  The state machine initializes at a start state (Init) then moves to default state (Manual) and waits for further transitions.<BR>
  The transitions can be invoked by either RC or from ground station.<BR>
  The state machine handles trasitions between states and guards against illeagal transitions of the states.<BR>
  The states that can be found in this state machine are:<BR>
  1. Init<BR>
  2. Manual<BR>
  3. Altitude Control<BR>
  4. Position Control<BR>
  5. Acrobatic<BR>

/**
  \page cfsvmopr VM Application Operation
   
  The following operations are carried out by the VM Application:
   1. Set Home Position
    ----
    a. Computes home latitutde, logitude, altitude and yaw from vehicle global position.<BR>
    b. Sets new home position on arming.<BR>
    c. Sets new home position on launch.<BR>

   2. Update Navigation State
    ----
    a. Updates naviagation state of vehicle status message based on ingested command.<BR>

   3. Monitor Activities
    ----
    a. Moniters the systems for red flags such as low battery, unarmed takeoffs, engine, gps faliure, rc loss.<BR>
    b. Responds to red flags with appropriate reporting or contengent actions.<BR>

   4. Send Housekeeping
    ----
    a. On receipt of a "Send HK" command, VM publishes a housekeeping message to the software bus containing general health and status.<BR>

/**
    \page cfsvmdg  VM Application Deployment Guide

  (Basic Instructions to the Author)
  ====  

  (Insert text describing steps required to integrate the application with a CFS system.  This should
   include:
     1) References to message IDs that need to be inserted into a CFS Scheduler table
     2) References to telemetry that can be generated
     3) Additional description of application configuration parameters that may need to be modified.
        For example, questions that a systems integrator needs to have answered before the application
        can be successfully integrated
     4) References to the application's performance ID)

  Initial Integration
  ====

    The first step in deploying the VM application is to do stuff.

  Application Tailoring to the Mission
  ----
    
    The vm_msgids.h, and the vm_perfids.h files are tailored for the mission.  
    These are built into the application during compilation.

  Application Tailoring to the Platform
  ----

    In the vm_platform_cfg.h file, there are configuration parameters that control
    VM application behavior.  This should be tailored to the specific platform
    needs.  This behavior is built into the application during compilation.

  CFS Scheduler Support
  ----

    TODO Discuss any commands that must be included in the CFS Scheduler Table
    and any related tailoring/configuration.

/**
    \page cfsvmcons VM Application Operational Constraints
  
  (Instructions to the author)
  ====

  (Insert text that describes:
    1) situations that would prevent the application from starting
    2) causes for the application to terminate prematurely
    3) commands that cannot be issued either out of order or without sufficient wait time, etc) 

  Application Termination
  ====

    Potential causes for VM to terminate prematurely are an error return from the 
    software bus in the application main loop or error return from one of the cFE table
    services functions when VM tries to do table management (check for updates, dump 
    requests etc.) during each housekeeping cycle. 

  Critical Data Store Operation
  ====
    
    When using the Critical Data Store (CDS), the results tables and housekeeping data
    will only be restored if the application was shut down through cFE Executive Services 
    and exited clean. If this is not the case, default values will be used 
    (see \ref cfsvmfaqs).

  General
  ====

  <B> (Q)
     What is the basic flow of the application?
  </B> <BR> <BR> <I>
     The VM application uses a common application format. When the app starts, 
     initialization is performed, then the app enters an infinite loop waiting for
     commands from the software bus.
