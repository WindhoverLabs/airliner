 *
 * Generic, programmable, procedural control signal mixers.
 *
 * This library implements a generic mixer interface that can be used
 * by any driver or subsytem that wants to combine several control signals
 * into a single output.
 *
 * Terminology
 * ===========
 *
 * control value
 *	A mixer input value, typically provided by some controlling
 *	component of the system.
 *
 * control group
 * 	A collection of controls provided by a single controlling component.
 *
 * actuator
 *	The mixer output value.
 *
 *
 * Mixing basics
 * =============
 *
 * An actuator derives its value from the combination of one or more
 * control values. Each of the control values is scaled according to
 * the actuator's configuration and then combined to produce the
 * actuator value, which may then be further scaled to suit the specific
 * output type.
 *
 * Internally, all scaling is performed using floating point values.
 * Inputs and outputs are clamped to the range -1.0 to 1.0.
 *
 * control    control   control
 *    |          |         |
 *    v          v         v
 *  scale      scale     scale
 *    |          |         |
 *    |          v         |
 *    +-------> mix <------+
 *               |
 *             scale
 *               |
 *               v
 *              out
 *
 * Scaling
 * -------
 *
 * Each scaler allows the input value to be scaled independently for
 * inputs greater/less than zero. An offset can be applied to the output,
 * as well as lower and upper boundary constraints.
 * Negative scaling factors cause the output to be inverted (negative input
 * produces positive output).
 *
 * Scaler pseudocode:
 *
 * if (input < 0)
 *     output = (input * NEGATIVE_SCALE) + OFFSET
 * else
 *     output = (input * POSITIVE_SCALE) + OFFSET
 *
 * if (output < LOWER_LIMIT)
 *     output = LOWER_LIMIT
 * if (output > UPPER_LIMIT)
 *     output = UPPER_LIMIT
 *
 *
 * Mixing
 * ------
 *
 * Mixing behaviour varies based on the specific mixer class; each
 * mixer class describes its behaviour in more detail.
 *
 *
 * Controls
 * --------
 *
 * The precise assignment of controls may vary depending on the
 * application, but the following assignments should be used
 * when appropriate.  Some mixer classes have specific assumptions
 * about the assignment of controls.
 *
 * control | standard meaning
 * --------+-----------------------
 *     0   | roll
 *     1   | pitch
 *     2   | yaw
 *     3   | primary thrust
